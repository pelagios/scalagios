Britain, once called Albion, is an island of the ocean and lies to the northwest, being opposite Germany, Gaul and Spain, which form the greater part of Europe, though at a considerable distance from them. It extends 8oo miles to the north, and is 200 miles broad, save only where several promontories stretch out further and, counting these, the whole circuit of the coast line covers 4,875 miles. To the south lies Belgic Gaul, from which the city called R11t11bi Porti4S (Which the English now corruptly call Reptacaestir) is the nearest port for travellers. Between this and the closest point in the land of the Morini, Gessoriaa4m, is a crossing of fifty miles or, as some writers have it, 450 stadia. Behind the island , where it lies open to the boundless ocean, are the Orkney islands.

The island is rich in crops and trees, and has good pasturage for cattle and beasts of burden. It also produces  vines in certain districts and has plenty of both land- and waterfowl  of various kinds. It is remarkable  too for its rivers, which abound in fish, particularly salmon and eels and for copious springs.  Seals as well as dolphins are frequently captured and even whales; besides these there are various kinds of shellfish, among which are mussels, and enclosed in these there are often found excellent pearls of every colour, red and purple, violet and green, but mostly white. There is also a great abundance of whelks, from which a scarlet-coloured dye is made, a most beautiful red which neither fades in the heat of the sun nor exposure to the rain; indeed the older it is the more beautiful it becomes.

The land possesses salt springs and warm springs and from them flow rivers which supply hot baths, suitable for all ages and both sexes, in separate places and adapted to the needs of each. For water, as St Basil says, acquires the quality of heat when it passes through certain metals, so that it not only becomes warm but even scalding hot .The land also has rich veins of metal, copper, iron, lead and silver. It produces a great deal of excellent jet , which is glossy black and burns when put into the fire and, when kindled, it drives away serpents; when it is warmed by rubbing it attracts whatever is applied to it, just as amber does. The country was once famous for its twenty-eight noble cities as well as innumerable fortified places equally well guarded by the strongest of walls and towers, gates and locks.

Because Britain lies almost under the North Pole, it has short nights in summer, so that often at midnight it is hard for those who are watching to say whether it is evening twilight which still lingers, or whether morning dawn has come, since the sun at night returns to the east through the regions towards the north without passing below the horizon. For this reason the summer days are extremely long. On the other hand the winter nights are also of great length, namely eighteen hours, doubtless because the sun has then departed to the region of Africa. In summer too the nights are extremely  short; so are the days in winter,  each consisting of six standard equinoctial hours, while in Arn1enia, Macedonia, Italy, and other countries in the same latitude the longest day or night consists of fifteen hours and the shortest of nine. 

At the present time, there are five languages in Britain, just as the divine law is written in five books, all devoted to seeking out and setting forth one and the same kind of wisdom, namely the knowledge of sublime truth and of true sublimity. These are the English, British, Irish, Pictish, as well as Latin languages; through the study of the scriptures, Latin is in general use among them all. To begin with, the inhabitants of the island were all Britons, from whom it receives its name; they sailed to Britain, so it is said, from the land of Armorica, and appropriated to themselves the southern part of it. After they had got possession of the greater part of the island, beginning from the south, it is related that the Pictish race from Scythia sailed out into the ocean in a few warships and were carried by the wind beyond the furthest bounds of Britain, reaching Ireland and landing on its northern shores. There they found the Irish race, and asked pern1ission to settle an10ng them but their request was refused . Now Ireland is the largest island of all next to Britain, and lies to the west of it. But though it is shorter than Britain to the north, yet in the south it extends far beyond the limits of that island and as far as the level of North Spain, though a great expanse of sea divides them. The Picts came to this island, as we have said, by sea and asked for the grant of a place to settle in. The Irish answered that the island would not hold them both; 'but', said they, 'we can give you some good advice as to what to do. We know of another island not far from our own, in an easterly direction, which we often see in the distance on clear days. If you go there, you can make a settlement for yourselves; but if anyone resists you, make use of our help.' And so the Picts went to Britain and proceeded to occupy the northern part of the island, because the Britons had seized the southern regions. As the Picts had no wives, they asked the Irish for some; the latter consented to give them women, only on condition that, in all cases of doubt, they should elect their kings from the female royal line rather than the male; and it is well known that the custom has been observed among the Picts to this day. In the course of time Britain received a third tribe in addition to the Britons and Picts, namely the Irish. These came from Ireland under their leader Reuda, and won lands among the Picts either by friendly treaty or by the sword. These they still possess. They are still called Dalreudii after this leader, Dal in their language signifying a part. 

Ireland is broader than Britain, is healthier and has a much milder climate, so that snow rarely lasts there for more than three days. Hay is never cut in the summer for winter use nor are stables built for their beasts. No reptile is found there nor could a serpent survive; for although serpents have often been brought from Britain, as soon as the ship approaches land they are affected by the scent of the air and quickly perish. In fact almost everything that the island produces is efficacious against poison. For instance, we have seen how, in the case of people suffering from snake-bite, the leaves of manuscripts from Ireland were scraped , and the scrapings put in water and given to the sufferer to drink. These scrapings at once absorbed the whole violence of the spreading poison and assuaged the swelling. The island abounds in milk and honey, nor does it lack vines, fish and birds. It is also noted for the hunting of stags and roedeer. It is properly the native land of the Irish; they emigrated from it as we have described and so fom1ed the third nation in Britain in addition to the Britons and the Piers. There is a very wide arn1 of the sea which originally divided the Britons from the Picts. It runs for miles into the land from the west. Here there is to this day a very strongly fortified British town called Alcluith. The Irish whom we have mentioned settled to the north of this arn1 of the sea and made their home there.
